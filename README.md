This program allows control of the original version of the HiTechAstro Mount Hub Pro - it looks like this:

It creates an ASCOM Alpaca driver that can be selected from the Switch and Focuser tabs in <a href="https://nighttime-imaging.eu/">N.I.N.A.</a>. It allows for control of the 4 dew heaters, 8 switched power ports and the stepper motor controller.

Commands can then be sent from the N.I.N.A. Equipment pages or the advanced sequencer to the Mount Hub Pro.

Setting can be customised in the settings.json file which is created when the program is first run. Focucer speed defaults to 50.
